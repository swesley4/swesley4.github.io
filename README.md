This hypertext is based on the concept of twine and is an interactive fiction named “Tudor History Narrative," which will provide the audience with the history of the Tudor rulers, starting from Henry, the seventh, to Elizabeth. This topicality enables users to make decisions during significant historical events: the Bosworth battle, the English Reformation, and the Spanish Armada’s defeat. Every decision in the story affects the story path and enables users to navigate political, social, and religious aspects of Tudor England.
Purpose and Target Audience
This project was devised to demonstrate the understanding of the skills required to develop digital stories and learning products for interested narrative audiences, with an emphasis on history. It also helps users of Twine show historical decisions and consequences in a more engaging manner. The narrative is thus useful to the student studying history, the instructor, and any other persons interested in the Tudor period and would like to learn in an experiential approach.
Key Features
•	Branching Choices: In the process, users are making decisions regarding key points, including whether to support the Reformation or not, which determines the story’s course and its results.
•	Historical Accuracy: Information and events described are real, so the show reflects the main events of the Tudor dynasty as closely as possible.
•	Interactive Learning: The use of the narrative format allows the users to be very active in the determinant or the decision-making process of the content analyzing the historical events.
•	Visual and Textual Customization: Text and background colors, as well as some fonts, become different depending on the passage, making the overall experience more immersive, and key scenes appear to be highlighted.
Structure and Flow
The story starts at the beginning of the Tudor family rule and asks the user for his or her opinions about concepts such as monarchy and religion. Major paths include:
The political decisions that the king made during the years of his reign are presented and compared to his contemporary decisions during and after the Bosworth Field battle and other related operations.
1.	Again, we take witnesses to this during the rule of Henry VII's decision on power stability and economic growth after Bosworth Field.
2.	Henry VIII’s Reformation: Decisions concerning religious change and the formation of the Church of England.
3.	Elizabeth I’s reign—important events like the Spanish Armada and the Elizabethan Age.
All of them affect the plot and show that people’s decisions define history—English history in this case.
Technical Details
•	Twine Version: This work was developed with the Twine 2.9.2 software in the Harlowe 3.3.9 format.
•	Customization: Custom CSS and passage-specific enchantments are referred to as a way of a shop’s thoughtful design to improve the perception of the text and illustrations.
•	Educational Citations: Some of the sources used are The Cult of Elizabeth, Strong, 1986, and England under the Tudors, Elton 2015 is incorporated into the text.

Future Applications
In this Twine narrative, the author establishes proficiencies in elements of digital literacy, games, and constraint-driven history. It could be expanded for use in the classroom, for teaching about early Texas and other topics of historical interest in America, or for showing one’s skills with interactive narratives during interviews for new jobs.
